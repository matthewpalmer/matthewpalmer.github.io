<div class="standing-invitation">
  <h2>üëã G‚Äôday!</h2>
  <p>
    I have a standing invitation for you to email me 
    about anything that‚Äôs on your mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    My email address is <strong>matt@matthewpalmer.net</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love helping people, answering questions, discussing ideas, and looking at
    work you‚Äôve done. Anything from blog posts to open source code to your latest designs.
    I‚Äôd like to see it!
  </p>

  <h3>Emails I Like Getting</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few areas where I might be particularly useful for you, generally
    at the intersection of development, product design, and marketing.

    <ul>
      <li>Your business, marketing, or tech strategy</li>
      <li>Building indie businesses</li>
      <li>Mac and Web apps</li>
      <li>Product design feedback (I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äùdesign is how it works‚Äù person than a pretty-buttons person.)</li>
      <li>Marketing tactics to grow your product</li>
      <li>Emoji</li>
    </ul>

    Non-technical things I‚Äôd also love to talk to you about

    <ul>
      <li><em>Your</em> niche interests, hobbies, or your job. One of my favourite things is how fractally interesting the details of peoples‚Äô jobs and hobbies are. (Once on a cross-country Amtrak trip I talked to a guy who ran an independent Christmas tree farming business. Turns out all the small players were being forced out by a large cartel who overpaid for land and undercut their prices.) Basically what I really want to know is all your super-industry-specific gossip and in-the-weeds technical details.</li>
      <li>Running, surfing, basketball, and the NBA</li>
      <li>Botanical gardens and parks</li>
      <li>Books! I like getting book recommendations</li>
      <li>Visiting Australia or Sydney? I have some tips</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>The Deal</h3>
  <p>
    I have the unfortunate combination of a) being bad at email, and b) getting
    a reasonable amount of email. Let me set your expectations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Will definitely get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You send me a personally written email about something that clearly matters to you</li>
      <li>You send me a direct and interesting email about something that I am well-suited to answer</li>
      <li>You want me to look at something you‚Äôve made</li>
      <li>You ask for feedback on an idea</li>
      <li>You need help finding a tech job</li>
      <li>You ask for a refund on a purchase. (It might be automated.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Will sometimes get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Vague or long-winded emails. Depends on busyness.</li>
      <li>You submit a bug report or piece of feedback</li>
      <li>You ask me to write some code for you</li>
      <li>You‚Äôre a recruiter (I‚Äôm not looking for work, but people who are looking tend to contact me, so I might introduce both of you.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Will not get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I‚Äôm clearly on some kind of <em>list</em></li>
      <li>You‚Äôve sent me a bulk email</li>
      <li>You‚Äôre asking me to participate in some survey (Github ‚Äùresearchers‚Äù, I‚Äôm looking at you.)</li>
      <li>You ask me to vaguely fix something in my open source libraries</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important!</strong> If I don‚Äôt respond within a week, feel free to send a follow-up email. I probably just got busy on the day your email came through. If you follow up and ask me to reply, I‚Äôll genuinely do my best to write you back.
  </p>
