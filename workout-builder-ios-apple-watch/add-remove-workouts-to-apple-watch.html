        <div class="guide-step">
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Open the <strong>Health</strong> app on your iPhone</p>

        <h2 id="add-workouts-to-watch">How do I add workouts to my Apple Watch</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to add workouts to your Apple Watch is by setting them up on your iPhone and sending them over. It’s way easier than doing it directly on the Watch. You can use <a href="./index.html">the free Workout Builder app</a> for this.</p>
        <p>You can technically create workouts from the Apple Watch, but it’s a bit of a pain on such a small screen.</p>

        <h2 id="create-custom-workouts">How do I create custom workouts for my Apple Watch</h2>
        <p>If you want to create your own custom workouts—like a 5k run or an advanced interval session—the best way to do it is through <a href="./index.html">the free Workout Builder app</a>. It’s a simple way to set up basic, advanced, or pacer workouts (e.g., running 5km in 30 minutes).</p>
        <p>It’s got a 4.7-star rating in the App Store. Plus, it’s free, with some cool extra features in the Premium version.</p>
