title: Edit and Change Text in Product Screenshots with Overwrite AI
category: ios
---

I’ve created a new app called Overwrite AI that lets you edit text in screenshots and product demos. 

<a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/overwrite-ai-change-image-screenshot-text/">Get Started with Overwrite AI here</a> for free.

It’s available on iOS and macOS.

## Why use Overwrite AI?

Before Overwrite AI, when I had to create screenshots for the App Store, marketing websites, platform marketplaces, and presentations, I had to set up a whole demo account with content that was suitable for sharing publicly.

This took a long time, was prone to looking bad, and added hours or days of extra work depending on how many platforms I needed to support.

With Overwrite AI, now I can just take a screenshot of my typical usage, feed the screenshot into Overwrite AI, and set the text in the screenshots to whatever I like. This means I have more control over my marketing assets, and can quickly update them if I need to tweak my messaging.

It makes my screenshots and marketing resources a lot more professional while also making them faster to create, and more likely to stay updated, and removes any private or personally identifiable information from the screenshots.
