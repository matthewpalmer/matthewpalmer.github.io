Iâ€™ve created a new app called Screenshot Text Editor AI that lets you edit text in screenshots and product demos.

## Why use Screenshot Text Editor AI?

Before Screenshot Text Editor AI, when I had to create screenshots for the App Store, marketing websites, platform marketplaces, and presentations, I had to set up a whole demo account with content that was suitable for sharing publicly.

This took a long time, was prone to looking bad, and added hours or days of extra work depending on how many platforms I needed to support.

With Screenshot Text Editor AI, now I can just take a screenshot of my typical usage, feed the screenshot into Screenshot Text Editor AI, and set the text in the screenshots to whatever I like. This means I have more control over my marketing assets, and can quickly update them if I need to tweak my messaging.

It makes my screenshots and marketing resources a lot more professional while also making them faster to create, and more likely to stay updated, and removes any private or personally identifiable information from the screenshots.
