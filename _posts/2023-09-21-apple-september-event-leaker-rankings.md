title: Which Canaries Carked It? Apple Event Leaker Power Rankings (September 2023)
category: apple
---

iPhone events leak like a sieve. Since we already know what‚Äôs going to happen, my new favourite thing is playing *Whose Byline Is It Anyway?* with the rumour mill. 

Let‚Äôs do a journalist power ranking for the September 2023 Apple Event.

**Mark Gurman ‚Äì Bloomberg\***

Gurman keeps his Woj status, getting everything right except for USB-C accessories, a new heart rate sensor, and 3D printing. At this point I feel like Apple should just hire Gurman to give iPhone status updates in executive meetings.

**Ming-Chi Kuo**

A lighter event for Ming-Chi Kuo, correctly predicting the iPhone 15 colours, and then doing a backflip on iPhone demand.

**TrendForce**
TrendForce gets two extremely specific, correct rumours here. Nice job.

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

From here it‚Äôs a tough day for the Twitter sickos.

**KosutamiSan**
The canary trap got ‚Äòem. Kosutami misses on all the colour-matched cables and USB-C accessories. It's probably tough not to claim something when you have a prototype in your hands.

**ShrimpApplePro**
Shrimp wins the AirPower Award for Biggest Vaporware, incorrectly predicting a black titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2.

**MajinBu**
Are MajinBu and KosutamiSan the same person, or do they just know the same guy? Like Kosutami, Majin missed on colour-matched cables. I guess Majin is distinguished by the fact they also got the USB-C battery pack rumour wrong?

**Setsuna Digital**
Setsuna incorrectly predicted an Apple Watch Ultra weight reduction. They did get the "basically unchanged" Series 9 report correct, which was the greatest meh in journalism since the Twitter Files.

**Unknownz21**
Unknownz rescues the good name and honest reputation of the Twitter randos, correctly reporting the titanium iPhone 15 Pro material.

**DuanRui**
DuanRui gets a pretty big scoop in the scheme of Apple‚Äôs accessory lineup, calling the move away from leather.

Unimportant Personal Addenda

While I'm here, I have some other notes:
* Does anyone else feel like the September event's focus on Apple's environmental prowess was pre-empting the potential e-waste press for the USB-C migration? I mean, Apple is *actually* doing a bunch of good things, which I love. But they really emphasised it more than usual.
* watchOS continues to be terrible, and makes the Apple Watch Ultra basically useless for any activity or sport adjacent to Ultra-ness. I have so many ways I'd like to improve watchOS
* No custom watch faces, and the Apple ones are bad
* The iOS Fitness app uses Bezos charts with no interactivity, making them basically useless for anything other than being nice looking
* There's no 12-inch Apple Silicon MacBook
* WorkoutKit has a weird API, and baffling limitations (you can create a 5x4 minute Badminton intervals workout, but you can't create a 5x4 minute swimming intervals workout)
