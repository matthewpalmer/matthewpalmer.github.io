  <h2>Which Libsyn feed type should I choose?</h2>
  <p>There are two ways of uploading your podcast episodes to Libsyn: using a <em>Libsyn feed</em> or using an <em>External feed</em>. The option you choose for Transducer needs to match the way you publish your podcast so that your podcast&rsquo;s audio files end up in the right place.</p>

  <p>Most people use a <em>Libsyn feed</em> unless they (or their website creator) has specifically set up their podcast feed so that the RSS feed is hosted somewhere other than Libsyn.</p>

  <p>You should choose <em>Libsyn feed</em> if any of these are what you do:
    <ul>
      <li>You normally only upload your file to Libsyn and you fill in all of the episode&rsquo;s information on Libsyn&rsquo;s website. If you have a website, it doesn&rsquo;t host your podcast&rsquo;s RSS feed.</li>
      <li>On Libsyn&rsquo;s website, you would click &ldquo;Add New Episode&rdquo; to add an episode of your podcast. This is the red option above.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>You should choose <em>External feed</em> if any of these are what you do:
    <ul>
      <li>You upload a file to Libsyn, but then go and manually publish a post in your podcast&rsquo;s RSS feed that contains a link to the audio file in Libsyn.</li>
      <li>On Libsyn&rsquo;s website, you would click &ldquo;Add File for Download Only&rdquo; to add an episode of your podcast. This is the blue option above.</li>
    </ul>
