  <h2>Custom scripts help and documentation</h2>
  <p>Transducer provides a way for advanced users to run their own custom scripts after uploading a podcast episode. These scripts can be treated as though they are run from the Terminal directly, which means you can use your preferred scripting language.</p>

  <p>Custom scripts are currently <strong>experimental</strong>. If you use custom scripts and have a suggestion for how they can be better, please <a href="mailto:matt@matthewpalmer.net">email me</a>. Also, if you have any trouble coming up with the right script to solve your problem, feel free to <a href="mailto:matt@matthewpalmer.net">email me</a> as well&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to help you out.</p>

  <h3>Please note</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      When entering the &ldquo;Script path&rdquo; in Transducer, the <strong>path must be absolute</strong> (i.e. it must be something like <code>/Users/matthewpalmer/scripts/...</code> and not <code>./scripts/...</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that the script at the provided path is <strong>executable</strong> (run <code>chmod&nbsp;+x&nbsp;/Users/matthewpalmer/scripts/script.sh</code> to make a file executable).
    </li>
    <li>
        Because the script will be run directly, it needs to start with a shebang (<code>#!</code>). For example, when running a Shell script the file should start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code> or for a Perl script <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Arguments</h3>
  <p>Transducer executes scripts using the absolute path provided, and passes the following fields to the script as command line arguments in the order listed below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Podcast name</li>
    <li>Artist</li>
    <li>Episode title</li>
    <li>Episode description</li>
    <li>Episode duration (hh:mm:ss)</li>
    <li>Episode length (bytes)</li>
    <li>Path to local file (absolute)</li>
    <li>Hosted file URL. This value depends on the host you selected:
      <ul>
        <li>SoundCloud&mdash;this URL points to the uploaded file&rsquo;s SoundCloud page, something like &ldquo;https://soundcloud.com/thetalkshow/142a&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Libsyn&mdash;this URL points to the uploaded file directly, something like &ldquo;http://traffic.libsyn.com/atpfm/atp115.mp3&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>As an example, if I enter <code>/Users/matthewpalmer/scripts/wordpress.sh</code> as the script for an episode uploaded to Libsyn, Transducer executes the equivalent to the following Terminal command:
    <pre>
    $ /Users/matthewpalmer/scripts/wordpress.sh "My Podcast Name" "Matthew Palmer"\
      "#17: Episode title" "The episode description" "01:12:45" "43214632"\ 
      "/Users/matthewpalmer/podcasts/episode-17.mp3"\ 
      "http://traffic.libsyn.com/matthewpalmer/episode-17.mp3"
    </pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a Shell script I wrote to create a new Jekyll post for an episode of my podcast.</p>

  <pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    # This script creates a new Jekyll post for a podcast episode uploaded to Libsyn.

    # Episode info from Transducer
    # Transducer passes each of these as command line arguments to your script
    episodeTitle=$3
    episodeDescription=$4
    episodeDuration=$5
    episodeLength=$6
    fileURL=$8

    # Where Jekyll stores its post files
    postsDirectory="/Users/matthewpalmer/Desktop/"

    # Metadata for the post
    yaml="---
    layout: episode
    title: \"$episodeTitle\"
    duration: \"$episodeDuration\"
    length: \"$episodeLength\"
    link: $fileURL
    subtitle: \"$episodeDescription\"
    ---"

    # Get a slug for the post
    read -p "Slug > " SLUG
    YMD=`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`

    # Write metadata to the file for the post
    echo "$yaml" > ${postsDirectory}/$YMD-$SLUG.markdown
  </pre>
