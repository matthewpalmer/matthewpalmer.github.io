<h1>Kubernetes Deployment Tutorial with Example YAML</h1>

<p>Everyone running applications on Kubernetes cluster uses a deployment. </p>

<p>It’s what you use to scale, roll out, and roll back versions of your applications.</p>

<p>With a deployment, you tell Kubernetes how many copies of a Pod you want running. The deployment takes care of everything else.</p>

<h2>What is a Deployment?</h2>

<p>A deployment is an object in Kubernetes that lets you manage a set of identical pods.</p>

<p>Without a deployment, you’d need to create, update, and delete a bunch of pods manually.</p>

<p>With a deployment, you declare a single object in a YAML file. This object is responsible for creating the pods, making sure they stay up to date, and ensuring there are enough of them running</p>

<p>You can also easily autoscale your applications using a Kubernetes deployment.</p>

<h2>YAML reference example</h2>

<p>Here’s some YAML that you can use as a template for creating your deployments.</p>

<p>First, take a look at the animation that annotates each section of the deployment YAML. (Scroll down for code that can be copy-and-pasted.)</p>

<p><img src="deployment-yaml-diagram.gif" alt="Deployment YAML example" /></p>

<p>(You can ignore the additional comments about the "service" here – this deployment was taken from a different example that also incorporated services.)</p>

<p>First, the <code>replicas</code> key sets the number of instances of the pod that the deployment should keep alive.</p>

<p>Next, we use a label selector to tell the deployment which pods are part of the deployment. This essentially says "all the pods matching these labels are grouped in our deployment."</p>

<p>After that, we have the <code>template</code> object.</p>

<p>This is interesting. It’s essentially a pod template jammed inside our deployment spec. When the deployment creates pods, it will create them using this template!</p>

<p>So everything under the <code>template</code> key is a regular pod specification.</p>

<p>In this case, the deployment will create pods that run <code>nginx-hostname</code> and with the configured labels.</p>

<h2>Deployment vs service</h2>

<p>What’s the difference between a deployment and a service?</p>

<p>A deployment is used to keep a set of pods running by creating pods from a template.</p>

<p>A service is used to allow network access to a set of pods.</p>

<p><img src="service-vs-deployment.png" alt="Service vs Deployment in Kubernetes" /></p>

<p>Both services and deployments choose which pods they operate on using labels and label selectors. This is where the overlap is.</p>

<p>You can use deployments independent of services. You can use services independent of deployments. They just go together really nicely!</p>

<p>This lets you do canary deployments. You add a new deployment version of a pod and run it alongside your existing deployment, but have both deployments handle requests to the service. Once deployed, you can verify the new deployment on a small proportion of the service's traffic, and gradually scale up the new deployment while decreasing the old one.</p>

<h2>How to delete a deployment in Kubernetes</h2>

<ol>
<li>If you’ve created your deployment from a file, you can use <code>kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml</code> to delete your deployment</li>
<li>If you’ve created your deployment from the command line, you can use <code>kubectl delete deployment my-deployment</code> to delete your deployment</li>
</ol>
