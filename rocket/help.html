      <h2 id="rocket-stopped-working">Rocket stopped working</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, macOS will stop delivering messages to Rocket so it can’t be triggered. This means that when you type “:thu” Rocket won’t appear. Sometimes this is fixed automatically by the OS, but you can take the following steps to fix it manually.
        
        <ol>
          <li>Quit Rocket via the 🚀 menu bar icon.</li>
          <li>Open System Preferences and select Security &amp; Privacy.</li>
          <li>Select Privacy in the tab bar and Accessibility in the left hand pane.</li>
          <li>Click the lock in the bottom left corner, confirm your authentication.</li>
          <li>In the list in the right hand pane, locate and select Rocket, then delete it by clicking the ‘–’ icon.</li>
          <li>Close System Preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Reboot your Mac</strong></li>
          <li>Open Rocket, it will prompt you to complete the setup tutorial which will re-enable Accessibility access.</li>
        </ol>

        After this, Rocket should be back to normal.
      </p>

      <h2 id="custom-categories">Everything is in the “Custom” category</h2>
      <p>
        For a couple of versions of Rocket, there was a bug where emoji would be imported into the incorrect category in the Browse &amp; Search window. Here’s how you can fix it. (Unfortunately your Rocket database will be deleted in this process, so you have to re-add any custom emoji or snippets.)
        
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you’re on the latest version of Rocket by clicking the 🚀 menu bar icon and selecting “Check for Updates”</li>
          <li>Quit Rocket via the 🚀 menu bar icon.</li>
          <li>Open Finder, press ⌘⇧G (Command-Shift-G)</li>
          <li>Enter “~/Library/Application Support/Rocket/” and hit Go</li>
          <li>Delete the database file by right-clicking the “rocket.db” file and click “Move to Trash”</li>
          <li>Open Rocket again</li>
        </ol>

        After this, emoji should appear in the correct categories.
      </p>

      <h2 id="extend-license">Extend your Rocket license</h2>
      <p>By default, Rocket licenses can be activated on two Macs. However, you can extend this for an additional two Macs free of charge. Fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/18tVGuErNFSmFg7O2">this form</a> to request an additional license, and email me if you need more than that 😄</p>

      <h2 id="request-refund">Requesting a refund</h2>
      <p>If you want to request a refund for Rocket, you can do so via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/d5bl3ExYz2AkIFSO2">this form</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="browser-control">Rocket, Safari, and Chrome – browser control</h2>
      <p>
        Rocket has a neat feature where it can be disabled on websites that already have an emoji
        picker. Some websites that have this are Trello, Github, and Slack. To implement this feature,
        Rocket queries the active web browser to find out what the current website is. It does so
        through AppleScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>What’s new in Mojave?</strong><br />
        Starting from macOS Mojave, Rocket lets you control whether you want Rocket to have this
        level of access to your web browsers. In general, Rocket will keep working either way,
        it just won’t be able to disable itself on certain websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>What does Rocket do with AppleScript and AppleEvent access?</strong><br />
        Rocket queries the browser’s web page URL. That’s it. It’s used purely to implement this feature. 
        We don’t collect, store, or transmit any other data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>Why does Rocket Finder access?</strong><br />
        Rocket needs control over the Finder to figure out 
        which browsers you have installed and which one of them is active. It doesn’t
        use its Finder access for anything else. (To be honest, we wish Rocket didn’t need access to the Finder, but it’s a technical limitation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>Why does Rocket need System Events access?</strong><br />
        If you have the "Start Rocket at Login" preference enabled,
        Rocket uses System Events to add a login item.
      </p>

      <h2 id="trigger-keys">Trigger keys</h2>
      <p>Trigger keys, followed by the start of an emoji name, are used to activate Rocket. For example “:wave” uses the trigger key ":". Rocket expects trigger keys to be a single punctuation mark. I’ve found that “:”, “(”, and “+” work best.</p>

      <h2 id="visual-studio-code">Disabling Rocket for Visual Studio Code</h2>
      <p>In Rocket’s preferences, select Visual Studio Code via the disabled apps list app picker. This will add ‘Electron’ to the list. Double-click the ‘Electron’ entry and change it to ‘Code’. Rocket will be disabled in Visual Studio Code.</p>

      <h2 id="intellij-idea">Disabling Rocket for IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
      <p>In Rocket’s preferences, select IntelliJ IDEA via the disabled apps list app picker. This will add ‘idea’ to the list. Double-click the ‘idea’ entry and change it to ‘IntelliJ IDEA’. Rocket will be disabled in IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
      
      <h2 id="add-custom-gifs">Adding custom gifs</h2>
      <p>Custom gifs and images can be added to Rocket once it has been licensed.</p>
      <p>After you purchase Rocket, you will be emailed a link to download a collection of gifs.</p>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the zip file from the link.</li>
          <li>Extract the contents of the zip file.</li>
          <li>Move the newly-created folder to a permanent location, for example in your Pictures folder. Rocket needs to read these files off your computer to insert gifs and images.</li>
          <li>Open Rocket’s Browse &amp; Search window via the menu bar icon, click the plus icon, and select gifs. Then click Add, and locate the folder you downloaded and extracted in the previous step.</li>
          <li>You can add multiple files to Rocket with Command-A or by shift-clicking on the first and last file to select all files in the folder.</li>
          <li>Click Add to add the files to Rocket’s shortcut list
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Your gifs should now be available&mdash;take a look around using the browser!</p>
